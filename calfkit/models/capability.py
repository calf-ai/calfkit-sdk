"""Capability control-plane wire model (spec §3.2).

A :class:`CapabilityRecord` is one MCP Toolbox instance's advertisement on the
capability control-plane topic: dispatch topic and tool definitions, keyed on the
wire by ``toolbox_id`` × ``worker_id`` (the control-plane instance key, held by the
substrate — never in the value). Records are calfkit-owned models — never the
vendored ``ToolDefinition`` — because compacted records outlive deploys, so the
wire shape must not move when the vendored library does.

Reader policy: tolerant (unknown fields ignored — a newer writer may add fields).
Staleness and newer-``schema_version`` filtering are owned by the reader's
:class:`~calfkit.controlplane.ControlPlaneView` (it hides such records and logs the
skip), so the resolver here only maps a live record to tool bindings.

    ``tools`` actually changes — separate from the liveness heartbeat — so liveness
    and content currency stay distinct. It is **advisory**: the substrate cannot
    enforce its monotonicity (the writing node owns the contract; a hand-rolled
    factory could pass ``now()``), and no production reader gates on it yet — it is
    wire surface for future ops/observability consumers.

    **Precondition for the collapsed view:** all replicas of one toolbox (same
    ``toolbox_id``) must advertise *equivalent* content. The view collapses replicas to
    one record by most-recent heartbeat — it does not merge tool sets — so two replicas
    with divergent tool lists would flap the agent's visible surface tick-to-tick. The
    dispatch topic is name-derived and identical across replicas, so routing is never
    wrong; only tool *visibility* would flap. Keep a toolbox's replicas pointed at the
    same server / tool set.

    Inherits the base's tolerant, frozen ``model_config`` (``extra="ignore"``); the
