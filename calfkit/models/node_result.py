    """Client-facing projection of the session state after a node returns.

    A ``InvocationResult`` is what a client receives from :meth:`Client.execute` /
    :meth:`InvocationHandle.result` — the final reply from an agent invocation. It is
    **client-only**: the consumer/runtime path uses a separate
    :class:`~calfkit.models.consumer_context.ConsumerContext`.

    The ``state`` field is the full session :class:`~calfkit.models.State` at
    the moment this envelope was published, exposing message history, in-flight
    tool calls/results, application metadata, runtime overrides, and any other
    state fields. ``message_history``, ``output_parts``, and ``metadata`` are
    convenience properties that read through ``state``.

    Treat ``InvocationResult``, its ``state``, and its ``deps`` as read-only. The
    dataclass is frozen, but ``state`` is a mutable Pydantic model and ``deps``
    is the envelope's dict typed as a read-only ``Mapping`` (both shared with the
    envelope, not copied — the ``Mapping`` annotation makes accidental
    ``result.deps[...] = ...`` a type error; the runtime object is still that
    shared dict):

    The caller's lifetime owns the instance — mutations are caller-visible and may
    corrupt any other code holding a parallel reference (caches, retry layers, etc.).

    ``InvocationResult`` is intentionally unhashable (``__hash__ = None``): the
    underlying ``state`` field is a mutable Pydantic model and cannot be
    placed in a set or used as a dict key safely. Use ``correlation_id`` if
    you need a hashable identifier.

    Build one with the :meth:`from_envelope` / :meth:`from_context` alternative
    constructors rather than calling the dataclass directly — they project the
    output from the delivery's reply slot and source identity from the
    transport-stamped context.

            ctx: The stamped session context. ``ctx.state``, ``ctx.emitter_node_id``,

                from the envelope body. When ``None``, falls back to

                use for validating ``DataPart.data`` against *output_type*. When
                ``None`` (default), a new adapter is constructed per call.
                Consumers pre-build at wiring time so schema-generation errors
                surface once at construction rather than per envelope.
            resources: The consuming node's lifecycle-managed resources, surfaced
                as ``InvocationResult.resources`` (read-only by type). Defaults to an
                empty mapping.
