class Handoff:
    """Identity-only handle declaring which peer agents this agent may **hand off** to (a Handoff —
    transfer of conversation control: the handing agent relinquishes and does **not** regain it; the peer
    continues the full conversation and returns to the original caller). Passed in
    ``Agent(peers=[Handoff(...)])``; gates and feeds the runtime-built ``HandoffRequest`` structured-output
    option. Two modes, mutually exclusive on one handle:

    - **curated** — ``Handoff("refunds", "billing")`` / ``Handoff(names=[...])``: the named peers are the
      only handoff targets (the v1 caller-side trust boundary, §7).
    - **open** — ``Handoff(discover=True)``: any live agent is a handoff target.

    Exactly one of {non-empty names, ``discover=True``} — both, or neither, raise. A byte-for-byte mirror of
    the :class:`Messaging` handle: frozen value semantics (names order-preserving-deduped, so equal handles
    compare and hash equal), a custom varargs ``__init__``, and no ``merge`` — multiple same-kind handles
    stay independent and the rendered directory dedupes by name. Deliberately does **not** implement the
    tool protocols (``resolve_tools``/``tool_bindings``), so a handle mistakenly placed in ``tools=`` falls
    through ``split_tool_declarations`` to its ``else -> TypeError`` rather than being silently absorbed
    (M4). The agent's-own-name reject lives in the ``Agent`` ctor (a handle can't see its enclosing agent's
    name, M2).

class HandoffRequest(BaseModel):
    """The model produces this as its turn's **output** to transfer control to a peer (§5.3, L4) — a BARE
    structured-output union member, NOT a tool. ``output_type = [final_output_type, HandoffRequest,
    DeferredToolRequests]`` keeps ``allow_text_output=True`` on every provider (a ``ToolOutput`` wrapper
    would force ``tool_choice=required``, which Anthropic rejects under extended thinking); calfkit
    discriminates by ``isinstance(result.output, HandoffRequest)`` for dispatch.

    This is the **stable base**. The per-turn subclass (:func:`_build_handoff_request`) narrows ``name`` to
    a ``Literal`` over the live directory and carries the directory as its ``__doc__``; ``__base__`` keeps
    ``isinstance`` valid across rebuilds.

    - ``name`` — the peer to hand off to (validated against the live ``Literal`` in the per-turn subclass).
    - ``message`` — the handing agent's summary/context for the peer, required non-empty (``min_length=1``),
      so an empty value is auto-retried by pydantic-ai like an out-of-``Literal`` ``name`` (L5/C2).
